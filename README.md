Q-Learning algorithm for pathfinding on a graph. The system finds the shortest path between two nodes in a graph, learning from the environment and improving its performance over time. It also incorporates optimal path knowledge using pre-calculated shortest paths and Q-learning to adjust its strategy dynamically.
